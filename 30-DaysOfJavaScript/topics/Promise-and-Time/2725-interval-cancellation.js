/**
 * âœ… Problem Name: [Interval Cancellation]
 * âœ… LeetCode Problem Number: [2725]
 * âœ… Difficulty: [Easy]
 * âœ… Date Solved: [2025-04-29]
 *
 * ğŸ§  Description:
 * [Given a function fn, an array of arguments args, and an interval time t, return a cancel function cancelFn.

After a delay of cancelTimeMs, the returned cancel function cancelFn will be invoked.]
 *
 * ğŸ§ª Examples:
 
 Example 1:

Input: fn = (x) => x * 2, args = [4], t = 35
Output: 
[
   {"time": 0, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 35, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 70, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 105, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 140, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 175, "returned": 8}
]
Explanation: 
const cancelTimeMs = 190;
const cancelFn = cancellable((x) => x * 2, [4], 35);
setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs);

Every 35ms, fn(4) is called. Until t=190ms, then it is cancelled.
1st fn call is at 0ms. fn(4) returns 8.
2nd fn call is at 35ms. fn(4) returns 8.
3rd fn call is at 70ms. fn(4) returns 8.
4th fn call is at 105ms. fn(4) returns 8.
5th fn call is at 140ms. fn(4) returns 8.
6th fn call is at 175ms. fn(4) returns 8.
Cancelled at 190ms
Example 2:

Input: fn = (x1, x2) => (x1 * x2), args = [2, 5], t = 30
Output: 
[
   {"time": 0, "returned": 10},
   {"time": 30, "returned": 10},
   {"time": 60, "returned": 10},
   {"time": 90, "returned": 10},
   {"time": 120, "returned": 10},
   {"time": 150, "returned": 10}
]
Explanation: 
const cancelTimeMs = 165; 
const cancelFn = cancellable((x1, x2) => (x1 * x2), [2, 5], 30) 
setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs)

Every 30ms, fn(2, 5) is called. Until t=165ms, then it is cancelled.
1st fn call is at 0ms 
2nd fn call is at 30ms 
3rd fn call is at 60ms 
4th fn call is at 90ms 
5th fn call is at 120ms 
6th fn call is at 150ms
Cancelled at 165ms
 *
 * ğŸ’¡ Approach:
 * [
*	â€¢ Call the `fn` function immediately with provided arguments.
* 	â€¢ Use `setInterval` to repeatedly call `fn` every `t` milliseconds.
* 	â€¢ Store the interval in a variable to cancel it later.
* 	â€¢ Return a function that clears the interval when called.

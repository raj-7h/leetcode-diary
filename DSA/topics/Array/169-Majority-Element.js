/**
 * âœ… Problem Name: [Majority Element]
 * âœ… LeetCode Problem Number: [169]
 * âœ… Difficulty: [Easy]
 * âœ… Date Solved: [2025-09-03]
 *
 * ðŸ§  Description:
 * [Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹ times.
 You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.]
 *
 * ðŸ§ª Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3

* ðŸ§ªExample 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
 *
 * 	â€¢	ðŸ’¡ Approach:
	â€¢	[ solved this approach by Mooreâ€™s Voting Algorithm.
	â€¢	  Created two variables majority and vote. majority initialized with the 0th element of nums and vote initialized with 1.
	â€¢	  Iterate through the array from index 1.
	â€¢	  If the current element is same as majority, increase vote.
	â€¢	  Else if vote is 0, change majority to the current element and reset vote = 1.
	â€¢	  Otherwise (when vote is not 0 and element is different), decrease vote.
	â€¢	  At the end, return majority as the majority element.

 * ðŸ’¡ Approach:
 * [â€¢	Create two variables:
	    â€¢	val to store the result
	    â€¢	index to iterate in the while loop
	â€¢	Use an if condition to check whether the array is empty:
	    â€¢	If the array is empty, return init as specified in the question
	â€¢	Otherwise, enter the while loop:
	    â€¢	In each iteration, call the function fn (provided as a parameter in the reduce function), passing in val and the current element of the array
	    â€¢	Store the return value of fn in val
	    â€¢	Update init with the new val (optional if reusing val)
	    â€¢	Increment index to continue the loop
	â€¢	After the loop ends, return val

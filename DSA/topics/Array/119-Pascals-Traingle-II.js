 * ðŸ§  Description:
 * [Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle.]
 *
 ðŸ§ªExample 1:
Input: rowIndex = 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]

ðŸ§ªExample 2:
Input: rowIndex = 0
Output: [1]

ðŸ§ªExample 3:
Input: rowIndex = 1
Output: [1,1]

ðŸ’¡ Approach â€” Pascalâ€™s Triangle II
	1.	Start with an empty structure called triangle, which will hold the rows built so far.
	2.	For each row index from 0 up to rowIndex:
	â€¢	Create a new array called row to store the current rowâ€™s values.
	3.	Within this row:
	â€¢	If the position is at the beginning or end â†’ place 1.
	â€¢	Otherwise â†’ take the two numbers from the row above (one above-left and one above-right) and add them together. This sum becomes the current value.
	4.	After finishing the row:
	â€¢	If the current row index equals rowIndex, return this row as the answer.
	â€¢	Otherwise, append it to triangle so the next row can be built.
	5.	The process stops once rowIndex is reached, so we donâ€™t need to build the full triangle.
